When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When i start working with other people, or want to save mi files in the cloud instead
	my computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because i can choose the time to get the new changes and have control on that 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	I would use forks when i want to copy the repostory and make changes without affect 
	the origin, clone it when i want to collaborate with other people and make branches 
	in big changes of code and dont affect the origin repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can work without internet without need to check the server for previous changes

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?

	Maybe use SVN, but is harder to keep a trace of all the changes, its more complicated.
	The easier thing of SVN is that only one person is able to modify one file so it wont 
	be conflicts problems.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

	You can do whatever you want in the branch with out affect the master branch, so you
	can have more control in the changes and dont affect the team
