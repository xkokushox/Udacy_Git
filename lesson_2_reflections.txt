What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	I need to initialize it to create a git sctructure to track the files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area in your working directory is only local, and saves
	the local changes of your files, and in the repository only saves
	the content from the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

	When you edit a file that is already in your staging area, that 
	content doesnt rewrite, so you can still commit your previous logic
	before stage that file again.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?

	When you want to change the arquitecture of the code, or want to 
	create multiple versions
